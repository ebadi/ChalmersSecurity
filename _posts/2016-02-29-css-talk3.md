**Abstract of Robertson's talk:**
The modern Web is heavily reliant on JavaScript for implementing
client-side web applications and extending browser functionality.  And
yet, despite varied efforts to isolate, tame, or analyze it, JavaScript
continues to enable new attacks against the web platform.

In this talk, I will present recent work on bypassing browser security
controls via a novel form of code reuse, and discuss a lightweight
static analysis to detect this class of vulnerabilities.  Then, I will
present ZigZag, a system for hardening JavaScript-based web applications
against client-side validation vulnerabilities that relies on invariant
detection and efficient instrumentation.

**Biographical Note**
William Robertson is an assistant professor of Computer Science at
Northeastern University in Boston, MA, and co-directs the NEU Systems
Security Lab. His research revolves around improving the security of
operating systems, mobile devices, and the web, making use of techniques
such as security by design, program analysis, and anomaly detection.
