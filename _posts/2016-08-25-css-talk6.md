**Abstract:**\\
In this talk we describe ZKBoo, a proposal for practically efficient
zero-knowledge arguments especially tailored for Boolean circuits and
report on a proof-of-concept implementation. As an highlight, we can
generate (resp. verify) a non-interactive proof for the SHA-1 circuit in
approximately 13ms (resp. 5ms), with a proof size of 444KB. Our
techniques are based on the “MPC-in-the-head” approach to zero-knowledge
of Ishai et al. (IKOS), which has been successfully used to achieve
significant asymptotic improvements. Our contributions include: 1) A
thorough analysis of the different variants of IKOS, which highlights
their pro and cons for practically relevant soundness parameters; 2) A
generalization and simplification of their approach, which leads to
faster Sigma-protocols (that can be made non-interactive using the
Fiat-Shamir heuristic) for statements of the form “I know x such that y
= f(x)” (where f is a circuit and y a public value); 3) A case study,
where we provide explicit protocols, implementations and benchmarking of
zero-knowledge protocols for the SHA-1 and SHA-256 circuits;

The paper was published at USENIX Security Symposium 2016 and received
best paper award.
