**Abstract:**\\
Data privacy is of increasing importance as most human activities leave digital traces in some information system. \\
In this presentation I will talk about data anonymization and more specifically about protection against identity disclosure in the publication of sparse multidimensional data.
The presentation will explain the notion of km-anonymity and how it is applied to collections of high dimensional data like set-values and tree-structured data.
I will sketch the techniques that anonymize data through generalization, record splitting (disassociation) and algorithms that work on tree-structured data.
The advantages and disadvantages of each approach will be summarized and I will discuss future research directions on data anonymization.
