**Abstract:**\\
Cryptography can in principle be used to protect users' data when stored
or transmitted, but in practice is error-prone and can potentially
result in a violation of a user's security concerns.
Information flow control (IFC) systems, on the other hand,
can automatically enforce security policies on data with
policy languages expressive enough to capture many desired
confidentiality and integrity requirements.
In this talk I will present CLIO, an Information flow control (IFC)
system that transparently incorporates cryptography
to enforce confidentiality and integrity policies on untrusted key-value storage.
CLIO insulates developers from explicitly manipulating keys and cryptographic
primitives by leveraging the policy language of the IFC system to
automatically use the appropriate keys and correct cryptographic operations.
Our system relies on a CPA-secure cryptosystem, and we show that CLIO is secure
with a novel proof technique composing cryptographic proof techniques with standard
programming language techniques.
