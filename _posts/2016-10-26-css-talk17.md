**Abstract:**\\
The new generation of Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) is a reality but the security threats mainly linked to the inclusion of wireless connectivity seem to have not received the adequate attention.  The security mechanisms  supported on-board of these devices must guarantee a balance between the patient safety and the security of the device -- that is, a trade-off between the normal operation mode and the emergency mode.   Once introduced the particularities and the security risks of these devices,  different security solutions will be revised in the context of identification, key generation, random number generation, etc.
