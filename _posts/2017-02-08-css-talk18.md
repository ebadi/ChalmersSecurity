**Abstract:**\\
Threat analysis is the cornerstone of security-by-design and privacy-by-design approaches for building more secure and privacy-friendly software systems. Threat analysis provides the means to assess a design model (e.g., a software architecture) and identify potential flaws early on in the software development life-cycle. This talk will overview the issues we (empirically) found in state-of-the-practice threat analysis techniques.
Moving forward, the talk will outline our present research directions in the field of threat analysis, with particular focus on a) improving the efficiency of said techniques and b) supporting automated analysis and refactoring.
