**Abstract:**\\

For several decades, researchers from different communities have
independently focused on protecting confidentiality of data. Two
distinct technologies have emerged for such purposes: Mandatory
Access Control (MAC) and Information-Flow Control (IFC)—the
former belonging to operating systems (OS) research, while the latter
to the programming languages community. These approaches
restrict how data gets propagated within a system in order to avoid
information leaks. In this scenario, the functional programming language
Haskell plays a unique privileged role: it is able to protect confidentiality via libraries.
This talk presents an (monadic) API which statically protects confidentiality even
in the presence of advanced features like exceptions, concurrency, and mutable data structures.

This talk is based on the paper "Functional Pearl: Two Can Keep a Secret, If One of Them Uses Haskell" presented in ICFP 2015.
