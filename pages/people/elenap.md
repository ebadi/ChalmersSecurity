I received the Bachelor degree in Mathematics from Padua University in 2011, 
and proceeded with a master in Applied Mathematics at Trento University. I graduated in 2013 with a thesis on Homomorphic Authentication Codes 
which included the research results of my 6-months experience as Project Officer at Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) under the supervision of Prof. [F.E. Oggier](http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~frederique/).
My PhD's research focuses on homomorphic encryption and signatures, with a particular attention for anonymity and information leakage issues. 
My supervisor is [Katerina Mitrokotsa](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~aikmitr/).
