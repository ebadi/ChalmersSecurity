I was a PhD student in the Computer Science and Engineering department in the Software Technology division at Chalmers University of Technology from 2011 to 2016. My thesis was on [Information-Flow Tracking for Web Security](http://chalmers.summon.serialssolutions.com/#!/search?bookMark=ePnHCXMw42JgAfZbUzkZtKD7aUDm67rl5JcrAEvfZND4rwJQXCE8NUkhGHpFGzeDnZtriLOHbnIG-NKQ4njwGc9J8aCzjwuQhq_iQYJwRcWp8UagDYCg2yQpNAAAh1pAUQ).
